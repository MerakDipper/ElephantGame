# FlyingFeather

In this iOS game, you will control a cute little elephant to push the feather flying forward. Touch right side of the ground to move the elephant forward, and touch the left side of the ground to move the elephant backward. Touch anywhere else to blow the air and push the feather!

In the same time, collect as many stars as you can! Don't let your feather fall onto the ground or blocked by the clouds! Any contact with the rain will moisture your feather and make it heavier!

Can't remember it? Don't worry! I also got a easy user on boarding level to bring you to the game!
